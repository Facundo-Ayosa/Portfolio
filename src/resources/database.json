It used deprecated functions and structure, like JS Classes for each JSX module instead of functions, lifecycle methods that are now unsafe, and so on, so I challenged myself to learn React all by myself, without any course nor explicit guide, forcing myself to adapt my reasoning for the new framework. To spice it up, I tried to learn how a Restful Api calls works, and making use of the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. The hardest problem was to learn Promises and Async programming, as I needed it for making request to the API.",

(Don't Repeat Yourself) and KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle. The hardest problem i had to overcome was that the Api had long quotes that didn't fit inside the card, what I ended up doing was filtering the request so that if the quote had more than 150 characters, it'd ask for a new one.",
