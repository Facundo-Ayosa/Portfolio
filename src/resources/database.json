            "longDescription": "My main objective with this project was to learn React using the docs and searching for answers in StackOverflow as the FreeCodeCamp Course I used to learn the basics of React didn't help much. It used deprecated functions and structure, like JS Classes for each JSX module instead of functions, lifecycle methods that are now unsafe, and so on, so I challenged myself to learn React all by myself, without any course nor explicit guide, forcing myself to adapt my reasoning for the new framework. To spice it up, I tried to learn how a Restful Api calls works, and making use of the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. The hardest problem was to learn Promises and Async programming, as I needed it for making request to the API.",

(Don't Repeat Yourself) and KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle. The hardest problem i had to overcome was that the Api had long quotes that didn't fit inside the card, what I ended up doing was filtering the request so that if the quote had more than 150 characters, it'd ask for a new one.",
